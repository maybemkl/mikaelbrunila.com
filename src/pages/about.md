I am a Postdoctoral researcher with the [Platial Analysis](https://platial.science/) and [Urban Politics and Governance](https://upgo.lab.mcgill.ca/) labs at McGill University. You can find my CV [here](/assets/CV_Brunila-Jan2025.pdf).

My primary interests are two-fold. 

1Ô∏è‚É£ I work on the application of statistical methods in general and natural language processing in particular to complex social problems. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ I am investigating the epistemological and historical foundations of natural language processing and large-language modeling, from the postwar cybernetics movement to contemporary practices.
